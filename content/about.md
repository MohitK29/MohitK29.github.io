# I am Mohit Kewlani, NYU Grad Student, looking for opportunities in SDE, DS and MLE roles.

# This is what describes me the best.

An autonomous and self-motivated student with demonstrated aptitude and experience designing web applications using full stack and Data Science projects with DS and Algo. I've also competed in several competitive programming events. Professors, coworkers, and peers have recognized me as a likeable, devoted performer who displays innovation, communication, and teamwork to achieve quality,
on-time project completion.
